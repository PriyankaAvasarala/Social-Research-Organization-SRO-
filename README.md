# Social-Research-Organization-SRO-
SRO, a nonprofit, is migrating its PHP website and MySQL database to AWS EC2 for enhanced security and scalability.
This project aimed to build a robust and scalable deployment solution for a social research organization's PHP application. Leveraging the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), I did this lab to ensure high availability, security, and adaptability. This project demands a multi-faceted approach to ensure a secure and scalable website environment: secure MySQL hosting, tiered access control for administrators and anonymous web users, efficient resource allocation on a t2.micro EC2 instance, simplified administration with secure SSH access, high availability through a load balancer, centralized data management in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and automated scaling using a launch template. To guarantee consistent performance and prevent bottlenecks, I deployed an Application Load Balancer (ALB) within the public subnet. This intelligent component efficiently distributed traffic across multiple web servers, ensuring high availability and seamless user experience.
To perform this operation, I will use an Amazon EC2 instance, for the application that has DB instance  and create a MySQL database with SQL dump file. I'll also update application parameters in the Parameter Store for secure database access. An additional layer of scalability was achieved using an autoscaling group. This group monitored pre-defined metrics and automatically adjusted the number of active web servers, ensuring optimal performance regardless of traffic variations.
Next, I focused on securing the sensitive application data. A secure and scalable MySQL database instance was deployed within the private subnet, maintaining data isolation and protection from unauthorized access. To further bolster security, I implemented a strict inbound rule on the RDS security group. This restriction allowed access only from the authorized application security group web servers, effectively shielding the database from malicious attempts. For secure external access to the database, I configured a dedicated bastion host. This gateway acted as a buffer, preventing direct access attempts, and maintaining a more secure environment. Additionally, the bastion host was equipped with the MySQL package, facilitating essential database management tasks.
Granular access control was achieved through the strategic use of security groups. These groups precisely defined and enforced access permissions for web servers, database, and the bastion host, safeguarding the entire infrastructure. To ensure seamless data access and secure storage of sensitive application configuration parameters like database credentials, I utilized the AWS System Manager Parameter Store. This centralized repository provided a secure and reliable way to manage and access these critical details. Finally, I imported the sample data using the bastion host and MySQL commands. This process populated the database with relevant information for testing and demonstration purposes.
Testing was crucial to ensure the application's functionality and responsiveness. I thoroughly verified the DNS name for proper accessibility, confirmed successful data import, and tested various functionalities to guarantee a smooth user experience. The carefully designed architecture and meticulous implementation resulted in a robust and reliable system offering several key benefits: high availability through the combined use of ALB, autoscaling, and redundant instances; scalability through automatic scaling based on traffic demands; enhanced security through security groups, IAM roles, and the bastion host; and adaptability for future deployments of similar PHP applications due to the chosen design principles.
The diagram depicts a highly available and scalable deployment solution for a PHP application on AWS. The Application Load Balancer (ALB) with port 80 distributes incoming traffic across several web servers located in the public subnet with IP addresses. A dedicated target group facilitates the seamless addition or removal of web servers without disrupting traffic flow. An autoscaling group ensures optimal performance by automatically adjusting the number of active web servers based on predefined metrics. The Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database securely stores application data within the private subnet and utilizes a security group to restrict access. A bastion host positioned at 10.0.0.4 acts as a secure gateway, granting authorized access to the private subnet and database. Security groups meticulously control traffic flow throughout the system, ensuring robust security. Gateway seamlessly connects the public and private subnets, enabling secure communication between components. This meticulously designed architecture effectively demonstrates a robust and secure deployment solution for a PHP application on AWS.
This project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of leveraging AWS to create a highly available, scalable, and secure deployment solution for a PHP application. The careful consideration of design decisions, meticulous implementation, and thorough testing resulted in a system that effectively meets the needs of the organization and serves as a valuable reference for future endeavors.
